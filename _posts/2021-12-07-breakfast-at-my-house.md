During the week we&#8217;re often walking out the door with a coffee in one hand and slice of toast in the other, but on weekends breakfast is never rushed. It&#8217;s a late affair, sometimes spilling over to lunch, with lots of reading and chatter in between courses of fruits, poached eggs, honey and toast. One of our favorite things we like to serve when friends are visiting are buckwheat blueberry pancakes.
